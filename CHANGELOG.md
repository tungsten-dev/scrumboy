# Changelog

> **Upgrades:** No breaking changes in **3.7.x** / **3.8.x** / **3.9.x** / **3.10.x** / **3.11.x** / **3.12.x** / **3.13.x** / **3.14.x** / **3.15.x** unless noted below.

## [3.15.4] - 2026-05-05

### Additions

- **Trello import (v1)** - Import a native Trello single-board JSON export into a new Scrumboy project: **`POST /api/import/trello/preview`** (preview counts, hard errors, warnings) and **`POST /api/import/trello`** (transactional durable project import). Board lists map to workflow columns (done-column heuristics, single-open-list synthetic **Done** lane, closed-list cards folded into detected done); labels become project tags; card body includes descriptions, dates, checklists, comments, attachments (links), and custom field text; per-todo and project **`import_metadata`** preserve Trello provenance. UI in **Settings** (backup area): file pick → preview → import when preview has no hard errors. Dedicated body size cap (**`MAX_TRELLO_IMPORT_BYTES`**, default 32 MiB).

### Tests

- **Trello** - Transform and import path coverage (**`internal/trelloimport`**, **`internal/httpapi`**, **`internal/store`**).

## [3.15.3] - 2026-05-05

### Improvements

- **Windows launcher key resolution** - Added a launcher helper flow to resolve and apply `SCRUMBOY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` from supported local sources for `win_run_full.bat` and `win_run_anonymous.bat`.

### Documentation

- **README and env example alignment** - Updated docs and examples to match the launcher-based encryption key guidance for local Windows runs.

## [3.15.2] - 2026-05-03

### Improvements

- **Anonymous mode landing (`/`)** - Replaced **`web/landing.html`** with redesigned page.

- **Landing assets** - Optimized image file sizes for **`web/`** resources used by the anonymous landing page (smaller JPEG/PNG payloads embedded in the binary).

- **Settings → Customization** - **VoiceFlow** is hidden when **`/api/auth/status`** is unavailable (**anonymous server mode**), aligned with wallpaper/profile gating so users do not see a preference that does not apply to anonymous boards.

### Frontend

- **`dist/dialogs/settings.js`** - Kept in sync with **`modules/dialogs/settings.ts`** for the VoiceFlow customization conditional.

## [3.15.1] - 2026-04-26

### Improvements

- **Agora (HTTP edge for MCP)** - `POST /agora/v1/invoke` requires an **`arguments`** field (**400** / **`missing arguments`** when absent). **`arguments: null`** normalizes to empty tool input where applicable. The outer invoke JSON always includes **`arguments`**. JSON-RPC **`error.data`** from MCP is preserved through the Agora adapter envelope.

### Documentation

- **Agoragentic** - **`docs/agoragentic.md`** (expanded guide), **`docs/examples/agoragentic-manifest.json`**, and a short pointer from **`docs/mcp.md`**.

### Tests

- **Agora** - Missing **`arguments`**, null **`arguments`**, JSON-RPC error **`data`** passthrough, stable discover envelope shape (**`ok`** / **`result`** / **`error`**), and array-shaped structured MCP results.
- **MCP** - Todo sprint patch schema and behavior in **`adapter_test`**, **`jsonrpc_test`**, and **`todos_tools_test`**.

## [3.15.0] - 2026-04-23

### Additions

- **Agora (HTTP edge for MCP)** - `POST /agora/v1/discover` and `POST /agora/v1/invoke` delegate in-process to the same MCP JSON-RPC path as `POST /mcp/rpc`, with an adapter outer envelope, JSON 404/405 for the `/agora/v1` namespace, and header auth passthrough. Wired ahead of the MCP route in the HTTP server.

## [3.14.5] - 2026-04-22

### Enhancements

- **Wall (Scrumbaby)** - **Right-click** a sticky note opens an in-dialog context menu: **Create Todo from Note** (opens New Todo with the note text seeded into the title field) and **Delete** (same confirmation pattern as drag-to-trash). Menu is mounted under the wall dialog and cleans up on every exit path via the wall `AbortSignal`.

- **Wall (Scrumbaby)** - **Multi-select delete** behavior is clearer: labels and prompts reflect how many notes are targeted; **right-click on a note that is not part of the current selection** deletes only that note without disturbing the rest of the selection; trash-drop and post-delete selection clearing align with the new flows.

- **Todo dialog** - `openTodoDialog` accepts optional **`initialTitle`** in create mode; seed text is collapsed to a single line (whitespace normalized) and respects the title input **`maxLength`** when set.

### Documentation

- **`docs/WALL.md`** - Documents the note right-click menu and distinguishes it from drag-to-trash delete.
- **README** - Adds a short **Sticky-Note Wall** bullet under Features (links to **`docs/WALL.md`**).

### Tests

- **`wall-note-context-menu`**, expanded **`wall-interactions`** / **`wall-gesture-matrix`**, and **`todo-initial-title`** coverage for the new behavior.

---

## [3.14.4] - 2026-04-22

### Improvements

- **Wall (Scrumbaby)** - SSE `wall.refresh_needed` handling is debounced in `wall-realtime` so bursts coalesce into a single `refetchDoc`/apply within a short window. While a local drag is in progress, the debounce re-arms via `isDragActive` / `setDragActive` (`wall-state`, `wall-drag-controller`) so the client does not refetch mid-drag; `wall` teardown clears the drag flag if the dialog closes during a drag.

- **Wall (Scrumbaby)** - After a successful wall document fetch, simple single-note field updates against an unchanged note and edge id set apply incrementally via `updateNoteElement` instead of wiping `innerHTML` and rebuilding the whole surface. Reduces hitching and visible blink after text saves when the server echoes `refresh_needed`. Full rebuild remains the fallback for structural changes. Covered by `wall-incremental-apply.test.ts`.

### Fixes

- **Wall (Scrumbaby)** - Right-click on a note for delete confirmation no longer arms the delayed single-click color cycle (primary-button guard before `armNoteInteraction`, defensive `cancelColorTimer` on the note `contextmenu` path). Adds a gesture-matrix test that replays `pointerdown` and `pointerup` with button 2 around `contextmenu`.

---

## [3.14.3] - 2026-04-22

### Improvements

- **Wall (Scrumbaby)** - Phase 1 drag transient coalescing: during multi-note drag, `wall-drag-controller` stores per-note positions each frame and drives a single group coalesce timer (`DRAG_TRANSIENT_COALESCE_MS`, 150ms) that flushes one `POST /wall/transient` per moved note when due, instead of per-participant per-`rAF` `scheduleTransient` calls. `TRANSIENT_COALESCE_MS` (100ms) is unchanged for drag-end and other callers (existing assertions preserved). Pointer-up clears any pending group timer before the existing drop-path `scheduleTransient` + flush so the final-position sequence stays the same.

---

## [3.14.2] - 2026-04-22

### Improvements

- **Wall (Scrumbaby)** - Wall client code split into focused modules (state, selection, API, drag/resize, realtime, edit controller) for easier maintenance and safer future changes.
- **Wall (Scrumbaby)** - Failed `POST /wall/transient` calls are counted and logged on a throttle; set **`window.__scrumboyWallDebug = true`** to surface **`console.warn`** for operator debugging without spamming normal sessions.
- **Tests** - Broader wall gesture and modal regression coverage (including confirm-dialog close paths and outside-click behavior).

### Fixes

- **Delete confirmation dialogs** - `showConfirmDialog` resolves reliably on every close path (including programmatic close), so follow-up flows such as drag-to-trash on desktop are not left with a hung promise.
- **Wall dialog** - Fullscreen wall uses an explicit modal contract (`data-dialog-content-root`, `data-no-outside-close`) so global outside-click handling does not treat in-canvas clicks as “outside” the dialog.

---

## [3.14.1] - 2026-04-21

### Enhancements

- **Wall (Scrumbaby)** - UX refinements on the sticky-note wall: visual branding polish and clearer wall guidance/instructions so note controls are easier to discover.

### Fixes

- **Delete confirmation dialogs** - Confirmation behavior is now wired consistently across the app; wall interactions include explicit right-click delete confirmation flow updates.

---

## [3.14.0] - 2026-04-21

### Enhancements

- **Wall (Scrumbaby)** - Sticky-note wall for **durable** project boards: full-viewport canvas, move and resize notes, single-click color cycle, double-click edit, right-click empty canvas to create, Shift-drag connections between notes, marquee and Ctrl/Meta multi-select with group drag and batch trash delete, real-time updates for collaborators. Desktop topbar entry; optional instance opt-out with **`SCRUMBOY_WALL_ENABLED`**. Controls summarized in **`docs/WALL.md`**.

---

## [3.13.1] - 2026-04-20

### Enhancements

- **VoiceFlow** - More reliable spoken **todo-by-title** handling: deterministic title references, clearer disambiguation, improved resolution (including title-target alternatives and suffix/number normalization in titles), with expanded coverage.

---

## [3.13.0] - 2026-04-20

### Features

- **VoiceFlow (voice commands)** - Board microphone opens a command modal supporting **create / move / assign / delete / open todo**, with Safe-Mode review and Hands-Free speech execution. Commands are parsed deterministically: speech alternatives are arbitrated into a single canonical command (or rejected as ambiguous), and spoken IDs like “number one” normalize to **`1`** before resolution/execution.

---


## [3.12.0] - 2026-04-16

### Improvements

- **Maintainability** - Backend router split into resource-focused files; frontend settings, todo dialog, and board modules decomposed behind stable facades; characterization tests added for extracted seams and key board routes.

---

## [3.11.10] - 2026-04-07

### Improvements

- **Board activity** - **`UpdateBoardActivity`** uses a single conditional **`UPDATE`** (throttled **`last_activity_at`**, rolling **`expires_at`** when expiring) instead of read-then-write. A missing project **`id`** still returns **`ErrNotFound`**; throttled calls return nil.

---

## [3.11.9] - 2026-04-07

### Improvements

- **Board reads (durable projects)** - Full board loads (`GetBoard`, `GetBoardPaged`, including the high-card-count per-lane path) and **MCP `board.get`** no longer call **`UpdateBoardActivity`** when **`expires_at`** is unset. **Expiring** boards keep the same throttled **`last_activity_at` / rolling `expires_at`** behavior on those reads; **lane-only** pagination was already unchanged. Todo mutations still refresh activity as before.

### Tests

- **`internal/store`** - `TestDurableBoardRead_DoesNotRefreshLastActivityAt`, `TestExpiringBoardRead_RefreshesLastActivityWhenStale`.
- **`internal/httpapi`** - **`TestGetBoard_ActivityTrackingBestEffort`** asserts the **`backlog`** column key in board JSON (workflow `column_key`), not legacy **`BACKLOG`**.

---

## [3.11.8] - 2026-04-07

### Fixes

- **Board - lane pagination** - `ListTodosForBoardLane` now derives **`nextCursor` from the last returned row** after trimming to `limit` (aligned with `flushLane`), fixing skipped rows, duplicate IDs across pages, and incorrect **filtered drag/drop** boundary fetches that used `limit=1` with the lane cursor.
- **Assignments - notifications** - **`todo.assigned`** SSE includes **`projectSlug`** (from the project row already loaded on assignee create/update; no extra DB round trip). Client uses centralized **`resolveNotificationProjectSlug`** (map → catalog → event) with **persisted row reconciliation** when the catalog slug changes.

### Tests

- **`internal/store`** - Pagination boundary contract, tag-filtered multi-page invariants, and related lane tests.
- **`internal/httpapi`** - Eventbus regression asserts **`projectSlug`** on wire; **`TestAPI_BoardPagedAndLaneEndpoint`** uses canonical **`backlog`** column keys in JSON and lane URL.
- **`internal/httpapi/web`** - Vitest for **`resolveNotificationProjectSlugCore`**.

---

## [3.11.7] - 2026-04-05

### Fixes

- **Router (full mode)** - Logged-out visitors opening a **board URL** (`/{slug}`) are no longer sent to the **login UI** before the app loads the board. The client-side gate still applies to **`/projects`** and the **dashboard** only; board access for anonymous users (e.g. shareable **temporary** boards) is enforced by **`GET /api/board/{slug}`** as before.

---

## [3.11.6] - 2026-04-05

### Fixes

- **Board (mobile)** - Lane tab **rounded corners** apply to **all** workflow keys via a generic **`.mobile-tab`** rule (not only the five built-in `[data-tab="…"]` presets). **Workflow color** changes from Settings update **mobile tabs and tab drop zones** on in-place board refresh (shared **`mobile-lane-tabs`** helpers); **`initDnD`** runs after the strip is final so Sortable targets stay valid. In-place sync uses **key→element maps** instead of repeated DOM scans.
- **Board (workflow keys)** - Client fallback **`columnsSpec()`** and default **lane meta / mobile tab** state use the same **canonical column keys** as the store/API (**`backlog`**, **`doing`**, etc.). **Legacy `mobileTab_*` localStorage** values (uppercase) map to current keys. **`.card--doing`** matches API todo **`DOING`** border styling; optimistic drag styling maps **`doing`** → existing **`in_progress`** card classes.

### Improvements

- **Board** - **`data-tab` / `data-status` / `data-column`** (and similar) use **`escapeHTML`** on lane keys in full render and incremental updates for parity with rebuild paths.
- **Dashboard** - **Load more**: mobile uses the same **▼** affordance as board lanes (centered); desktop keeps a ghost **Load more** button; **`aria-busy`** and clearer **`aria-label`**; glyph as explicit **Unicode** (**`\u25BC`**) in source.

### Tests

- **`internal/httpapi/web_assets_test.go`** - Asserts **CSS** preset selectors match canonical default keys, **`columnsSpec`** keys, **`buildMobileTabsInnerHtml`** structure (tabs + drop zones), board sync helpers, and **`.card--doing`**. Comments note these are **embedded-source checks**, not browser/E2E coverage (manual QA still required for DnD and workflow mutations).

---

## [3.11.5] - 2026-04-05

### Features

- **Wallpaper** - Optional built-in image at **`/wallpapers/default.jpg`**: empty preference tries to load it; if the file is missing or fails to load, wallpaper stays **off** (no bundled placeholder). **Builtin** mode is client-only in **localStorage**; server prefs remain **off** / **color** / **image** as before.
- **Settings → Customization** - When a wallpaper is active, the Settings dialog uses a lighter **backdrop** and a slightly translucent panel so the same background shows through; tuned for readability (stronger panel and backdrop than the first pass).

### Improvements

- **Board** - Lane **column** backgrounds use a light **`color-mix`** tint from each workflow lane’s **`color`** when the API provides it (**`col--lane-tint`** / **`--lane-accent`**), so custom lane keys and themed projects match the header again-not only the five fixed **`data-column`** CSS rules in light mode.

---

## [3.11.4] - 2026-04-05

### Features

- **Assignments - notification panel** - The bottom-right badge **toggles** an inbox panel (`#global-notification-panel`) instead of clearing the count on click. **localStorage** list **`scrumboy_notifications_v1_{userId}`** stores up to **100** assignment rows (prepend, dedupe by event **id** or **projectId + todoId + type**), with **read/unread** state and **“Mark all as read”**. Rows open **`/{slug}?openTodoId={id}`** via the SPA router when a project slug is known; slugs are filled from the existing **projects** cache (dashboard / project list / board load) or resolved on demand when needed.
- **Web Push (PWA)** - **Service worker** **`notificationclick`** opens **`/{projectSlug}?openTodoId={todoId}`** when the push payload includes both fields (otherwise **`/`**), focusing an existing window and using **`WindowClient.navigate`** when supported.

### Improvements

- **Assignments - performance** - Inbox updates stay off the realtime hot path: **no `GET /api/projects`** during **`todo.assigned`** handling; **debounced** persistence and **`notifications:updated`** emissions reduce **localStorage** and UI churn during bursty SSE. Legacy **`incrementUnread()`** / **`scrumboy_unread_v1_`** remain for migration; the badge count is driven by **unread rows in the inbox list**.

---

## [3.11.3] - 2026-04-05

### Features

- **Board (mobile)** - When a todo drag starts, lane tabs briefly flash (**300ms**) so it is obvious they accept drops; tab labels stay readable above the drop overlays.
- **Web Push (PWA)** - After sign-in, the client auto-subscribes when **both** VAPID keys are set on the server; **`SCRUMBOY_PUSH_BY_DEFAULT_IF_VAPID`** removed (VAPID presence is the operator signal). Per-user autosub progress in **localStorage** with resilient retry when the permission prompt is dismissed vs blocked.

### Fixes

- **Board (drag-and-drop)** - Success toast **“Todo moved to …”** only when the todo changes **lane**; same-lane reorder no longer shows a redundant toast (lane titles still come from the board workflow, not hardcoded names).

### Improvements

- **Settings → Customization** - **Background notifications (PWA)** is grayed out with a one-line notice when Web Push is unavailable (no VAPID on the server, or anonymous board mode).

### Documentation

- **`docs/mcp.md`** - MCP documentation added/expanded.
- **`docs/pwa.md`** - Push flow and env vars aligned with streamlined enablement; key generation note includes **[VapidKeys.com](https://vapidkeys.com/)**.

---

## [3.11.2] - 2026-04-04

### Fixes

- **Web Push (PWA)** - **`notificationclick`** focuses an existing same-origin app window or opens **`/`**; no navigation by **`projectSlug`** / **`todoId`** (payload fields kept for a future notification center). **`focus()`** that does not return a client still falls through to **`openWindow('/')`**.
- **Assignment chime (mobile)** - **`notify.mp3`** added; **`assignmentNotify`** uses **`<audio><source>`** with **MP3 first** and **Ogg** second so **iOS Safari** (no Vorbis/Ogg decode) can play the sound. Toast and unread badge behavior unchanged.

### Improvements

- **Web Push API** - **`GET /api/push/vapid-public-key`** and **`POST /api/push/subscribe`** return **503** when VAPID is incomplete (either public or private key missing). **`DELETE /api/push/unsubscribe`** unchanged so rows can still be removed if keys are later disabled.
- **Router (anonymous mode)** - Initial load no longer calls **`unsubscribeFromPush`** (push is unavailable in anonymous mode; avoids pointless local churn).

### Other

- **README** - VAPID-related env table dashes normalized (encoding-safe).
- **Dependencies** - **`github.com/SherClockHolmes/webpush-go`** listed as a direct module dependency; **`go mod tidy`**.
- **Comments** - **`router.ts`**: logged-out push cleanup is best-effort per device; server DELETE may fail after auth teardown; stale DB rows are pruned when send fails.
- **Tests** - **`internal/httpapi/push_routes_test.go`**, **`push_notify_test.go`** for push routes and notifier edge cases.

---

## [3.11.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixes

- **Project list** - Invited users now see **authenticated** temporary boards (with a creator) they belong to via **`project_members`**. The membership branch does not apply when **`creator_user_id`** is null, so anonymous paste boards never appear from stray membership rows alone.
- **Todo dialog (roles)** - **Viewers:** read-only title, status, body, links; Save off; “View Todo” when nothing to save. **Contributors:** title and status locked (body-only when assigned, same as API). Submit handler checks permissions; viewers no longer enter bulk-select via Ctrl/Cmd+click on cards.

### Other

- **Keycloak (local dev)** - `docs/keycloak/realm-scrumboy-local.json` import + `docs/keycloak/README.md` (issuer env, public-client secret placeholder).
- **Tests** - `internal/store/list_projects_test.go` for temp-board listing.

---

## [3.11.0] - 2026-04-04

### Features

- **App-wide realtime (full mode)** - **`GET /api/me/realtime`** merges the user hub stream with **`hub.Subscribe`** for every project from **`ListProjects`** (one **`EventSource`** while logged in). **`Hub`** adds **`SubscribeUser`** / **`EmitUser`**; **`sseBridge`** duplicates **`todo.assigned`** to the assignee’s user channel (same JSON as the project emit). Wire events include stable **`id`** for client dedupe; **`refresh_needed`** from the assignment path uses a distinct composite id so it does not collide with the assignment payload.
- **Frontend** - **`core/realtime.ts`**: global stream, **`seenEvents`** dedupe before side effects, **`emit('realtime:event')`**. Logged-in boards listen on the bus only (no per-board **`EventSource`**); anonymous boards keep **`/api/board/{slug}/events`**. Strict rule: never both connections at once.
- **Unread badge** - **`core/notifications.ts`**: count, optional per-user **`localStorage`**, **`#global-notification-badge`** (bottom-right), **`notifications:updated`** bus; increments only after dedupe and assignee match; skips increment when already on that project’s board; clear on badge click; hydrate/clear on user change in **`router.ts`**.

### Other

- **Settings / Customization** - Desktop notification status copy uses a regular hyphen after **Enabled** (was an em dash). Assignment badge hover **`title`** / **`aria-label`**: *N todos have been assigned to you* (singular phrasing for count **1**).

---

## [3.10.0] - 2026-04-04

### Features

- **Event bus + SSE** - **`internal/eventbus`** fanout; **`PublishEvent`** on the server. Board refresh / members events go through the bus; **`sseBridge`** keeps the same SSE JSON as before.
- **`todo.assigned`** - Published after commit from **`CreateTodo`** / **`UpdateTodo`** when assignee changes (non-anonymous temp boards). SSE uses reason **`todo_assigned`**; handlers skip duplicate **`todo_created`** / **`todo_updated`** refresh when **`AssignmentChanged`**.
- **Webhooks (full mode)** - **`POST` / `GET` / `DELETE`** **`/api/webhooks`** (maintainer, session; **404** in anonymous mode). Migration **050**; optional HMAC **`X-Scrumboy-Signature`**; async queue + worker, retries, JSON envelope with event **`id`** (for idempotency). Dispatcher enqueues in a goroutine with a detached context so SSE is not blocked.

### Fixes

- **Shutdown** - HTTP **`Shutdown`** before cancelling the webhook worker.
- **CreateTodo** - Same **`!isAnonymousBoard`** gate as **`UpdateTodo`** for assignment events.

### Other

- Tests: **`eventbus_regression_test.go`**. Docs: README webhooks section + TOC. Dep: **`github.com/google/uuid`**.

---

## [3.9.4] - 2026-04-04

### Fixes

- **OIDC / SSO - account linking for existing users** - When a user signs in with **Continue with SSO** and the IdP returns a **verified** email that already matches a **`users`** row (e.g. bootstrap owner or admin-created account from before OIDC), Scrumboy now **links** the **`(issuer, subject)`** identity in **`user_oidc_identities`** to that user instead of failing with a duplicate-email conflict. Local password hashes are unchanged; SSO and password login can both work for the same account when local auth remains enabled. Integration test **`TestOIDCAutoLinkExistingUser`** covers the full callback flow; the test **fake IdP** now relays **`nonce`** from authorize → token so end-to-end OIDC tests match real providers.

---

## [3.9.3] - 2026-04-05

### Improvements

- **Board search (Escape)** - While the search field is focused, **Esc** blurs it and, when there is text, clears the query using the same path as the clear control (**`setSearchParam("")`** + board reload). Escape handling runs **before** the global modal gate so search dismisses consistently.
- **Settings** - **Tab** cycles the visible settings tabs (wrapped); **Shift+Tab** is left for normal focus. Tab switching goes through a single **`switchSettingsTab`** helper (workflow dirty confirm, cache invalidation, re-render). Sprints tab empty copy now says **Create one above** (the form is above the list).
- **Main navigation** - **Shift+Tab** cycles **Dashboard → Projects → Temporary** in reverse (**Tab** still cycles forward). Tab vs Shift+Tab are dispatched explicitly by chord so the two actions cannot both run.
- **Dashboard** - Initial dashboard load also fetches **`/api/projects`** so chip counts stay correct on a direct **`/dashboard`** visit; failed project fetch does not wipe an existing in-memory list.
- **Projects / Dashboard chips** - **Temporary** vs **Temporary Boards** label uses one shared helper (**`temporaryBoardsNavLabel`**, **767px** breakpoint) so dashboard and projects stay aligned.

---

## [3.9.2] - (no release)

### Note

- **Version number skipped in git** - There is no commit in this repository that sets **`internal/version/version.go`** to **3.9.2**, and no **`README`** / **`CHANGELOG`** reference to **3.9.2** before this note. After **3.9.1**, the next bump was **3.9.3** (commit **`2c5b576`**, *multiple UX enhancements…*). No separate user-facing changes are recorded under **3.9.2**; see **3.9.1** (OIDC **`dist/`** rebuild) and **3.9.3** (UX items above) for work in that window.

---

## [3.9.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixes

- **OIDC auth UI (embedded `dist/`)** - Rebuilt **`internal/httpapi/web/dist/`** so the compiled bundle matches **`modules/`**: router applies **`oidcEnabled`** / **`localAuthEnabled`** from **`GET /api/auth/status`**, and the login screen shows **Continue with SSO** when OIDC is configured (previously only TypeScript sources were updated in **3.9.0**, so production builds loading **`dist/router.js`** did not surface the SSO button).

---

## [3.9.0] - 2026-04-03

### Features

- **OIDC / SSO (optional)** - Single sign-on when all four env vars are set: **`SCRUMBOY_OIDC_ISSUER`**, **`SCRUMBOY_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`**, **`SCRUMBOY_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`**, **`SCRUMBOY_OIDC_REDIRECT_URL`**. Uses OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with **PKCE (S256)** and a confidential client; **OIDC Discovery** and **JWKS** for the ID token; claims from the ID token only (no Userinfo). Successful login creates a normal **`scrumboy_session`** (no JWTs in the browser). Endpoints: **`GET /api/auth/oidc/login`** (optional **`return_to`**), **`GET /api/auth/oidc/callback`**. **`GET /api/auth/status`** adds **`oidcEnabled`** and **`localAuthEnabled`**. Optional **`SCRUMBOY_OIDC_LOCAL_AUTH_DISABLED=true`** disables password bootstrap/login while OIDC is configured. In **anonymous** mode, OIDC routes return **404** like other auth actions.
- **Auth UI** - **Continue with SSO** when OIDC is enabled; **`oidc_error`** query handling for failed callbacks.
- **Database** - New **`user_oidc_identities`** table (**`UNIQUE(issuer, subject)`**); **`users.password_hash`** is nullable for OIDC-only users (migration **049**).

### Documentation

- **`docs/oidc.md`** - Self-hosted operator guide: env vars, flow, constraints, reverse proxy, troubleshooting, security notes, explicit non-goals.
- **`API.md`**, **`README.md`**, **`SECURITY.md`** - OIDC endpoints, configuration, and session/security summary.

### Dependencies

- **`github.com/coreos/go-oidc/v3`**, **`golang.org/x/oauth2`** (OIDC client and token exchange); **`github.com/go-jose/go-jose/v4`** (integration tests for stub IdP JWTs).

---

## [3.8.0] - 2026-04-03

### Features

- **MCP JSON-RPC: `tools/list` and `tools/call`** on **`POST /mcp/rpc`** - Completes the spec-oriented MCP loop alongside existing **`initialize`** / **`notifications/initialized`**. **`tools/list`** returns tools with **`name`**, **`description`**, and **`inputSchema`** (JSON Schema with **`required`** and tight objects where defined); the catalog starts with four tools (**`projects.list`**, **`todos.create`**, **`todos.get`**, **`todos.update`**) and will grow over time. **`tools/call`** accepts **`params.name`** and **`params.arguments`**, reuses the same tool handlers as legacy **`POST /mcp`**, and returns success as **`result.content[]`** with **`type: "json"`** and the tool payload in **`json`**. Discovery and invocation are **stateless** (no **`initialize`** required for **`tools/list`** or **`tools/call`**). Errors use JSON-RPC codes (**`-32601`** unknown tool, **`-32602`** invalid params / validation, **`-32603`** internal); unknown tools may include **`error.data`** with **`name`**.

### Improvements

- **Catalog `required` handling** - Pre-call checks read the **`required`** array whether it is stored as **`[]string`** (in-memory catalog) or **`[]any`** (e.g. after JSON round-trip), avoiding silent skips.
- **`tools/call` shape errors** - Clearer **`missing params`** / **`missing params.name`** messages for invalid requests.

### Documentation

- **`API.md`** - New **JSON-RPC MCP endpoint (spec-compatible)** section for **`POST /mcp/rpc`**: protocol rules, supported methods, response shapes, auth (same as **`/mcp`**), and how this differs from the legacy **`/mcp`** envelope.
- **`README.md`** - **MCP (JSON-RPC) for AI agents** subsection with **`curl`** examples (**`initialize`**, **`tools/list`**, **`tools/call`**), pointer to **`API.md`**, and notes on HTTP JSON-RPC vs stdio MCP clients.

## [3.7.8] - 2026-04-03

### Features

- **MCP JSON-RPC (Phase 1)** - New **`POST /mcp/rpc`** endpoint using **JSON-RPC 2.0** alongside the existing **`/mcp`** `{ "tool", "input" }` API (unchanged). Supports **`initialize`** (protocol version **2024-11-05**, `capabilities.tools`, `serverInfo`), **`notifications/initialized`** and **`initialized`** as notifications (**204** empty body), and spec error codes (e.g. **-32601** method not found). **`tools/list`** and **`tools/call`** added in **3.8.0**.

---

## [3.7.7] - 2026-04-03

### Features

- **Dashboard todo sort** - Sort assigned todos by **Activity** (recently updated, default) or **Board order** (per project: workflow column position, then lane rank). **`GET /api/dashboard/todos`** supports optional query **`sort=activity`** or **`sort=board`**; pagination **`cursor`** is tied to the active sort, and a cursor from the wrong mode is rejected with **400** **`VALIDATION_ERROR`**.

### Improvements

- **Todo dialog (mobile)** - New/edit todo form scrolls inside the modal on narrow viewports so header, fields, and Save stay usable (aligned with Settings-style scrolling).
- **Dashboard sort preference (signed-in)** - Choice is saved under **`user_preferences`** key **`dashboardTodoSort`** and restored after login (still mirrored in **localStorage** for fast defaults). Server hydrate skips applying the stored value when it already matches in-memory state, and does not overwrite a sort the user changed locally before preferences finish loading.
